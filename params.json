This is implementation of diploma thesis for evaluating programmer's knowledges based on participating on software development project. The analysator is implemented as extension to Eclipse IDE.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n- Java Platform SE 7 (or higher)\r\n- Java projects versioned in Git\r\n- Eclipse IDE\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nQuick Installation Guide:\r\n\r\n1. Eclipse → Help → Install New Software... → Available Software Sites → Add\r\n\t\r\n\t Name: Analysator\r\n\t \r\n\t Location: [http://feromakovi.github.io/perconik/update](http://feromakovi.github.io/perconik/update)\r\n2. Restart Eclipse\r\n3. Download compressed [file with neccessary models](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13095494/models.zip)\r\n4. Unzip models to folder with writable permission\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nWhen you have extension installed switch to `Package Explorer` view.
